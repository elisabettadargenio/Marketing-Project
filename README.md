# Marketing-Project
The goal of the project is to predict the Propensity to Buy using marketing measures such as the Average Item Value, the Spending on different channels.  
We also want to explore the effect of the Markdown/Sales Promotions (MD) on the Propensity to Buy an item (CR).

The adapted models are the Linear Regression model, Generalized Additive Models (GAM), Regression Tree, Neural Network, Bagging and Random Forest.
Data are divided into two files: "merchandinsingProductData.csv", containing some retail measures gathered from the last season/collection; "webMarketingProductData.csv" containing data regarding marketing KPIs on the same products.  
We also have the "testSet.csv" file with new data to make predictions with the chosen model.

In the R code there is the code to carry out the project and also the comments of the results.   
Separately the "Insigths.pdf" file is presented which includes the analysis of The effect of the Markdown/Sales promotions (MD) on the Propensity to Buy an item, designed for non-technical colleagues.
